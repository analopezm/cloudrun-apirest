# GSP761 Developing a REST API with Go and Cloud Run

Qwiklabs lab demonstrating how to develop with Cloud Run

## Overview

In this lab, you'll help Ruby and Patrick to give insurance companies access to customer data without exposing Personal Identifiable Information (PII). 
You will build a secure Representational State Transfer (REST) API gateway using Cloud Run, which is serverless. 
This will let the insurance companies see the total cost of treatments without seeing customers' PII.
